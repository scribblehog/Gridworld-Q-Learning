# Gridworld-Q-Learning

This code is partly based on the work of Zhang https://github.com/MJeremy2017/reinforcement-learning-implementation.
Specifically, the Q-Learning algorithm was created by Zhang, and I have used it and updated sections where needed.
All the data analysis section is original.
I have indicated in the code where I have changed or added modules.
